# Operation: Grand Line Viral Strategy

## Core Concept
The "Wanted Poster" generator is the viral engine. People love seeing their PFP on a bounty poster. It triggers ego and tribalism.

## Phase 1: The Crew Gathering (Pre-Launch)
**Goal:** 1,000 Telegram Members
**Tactic:** "Show me your bounty." 
- We don't just shill the coin; we shill the *status* of the holder.
- Influencer Outreach: DM micro-influencers with a pre-made Wanted Poster featuring *their* PFP and a massive bounty. "The Marines have put a bounty on you. Are you joining the crew?"

## Phase 2: The Set Sail (Launch Day)
**Goal:** $1M Volume
**Tactic:** #BerryBounty Contest
- Users must generate a poster on the website.
- Tweet it with $BERRY and #JoinTheCrew.
- Random winners get airdrops based on the "Bounty" number on their generated poster.

## Phase 3: The Warlords (Post-Launch)
**Goal:** Binance Listing
**Tactic:** Community Raids
- Use the "Renounced Ownership" and "Tax Burn" as key selling points.
- "We burn gold to feed the sea." (Deflationary narrative).
